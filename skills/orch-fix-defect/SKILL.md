description: Orchestrate fixing a bug — reproduce it as a failing regression test,
  fix to green, review, and gated commit — by delegating each phase to the matching
  ECC agent. Use when existing behavior is broken or wrong.

## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

# orch-fix-defect

Actor · action · target: **orch · fix · defect**. Thin wrapper over the shared
engine in [`orch-pipeline`](../orch-pipeline/SKILL.md).

## When to Use

- Something is **broken**: wrong output, an error, a crash, a regression.
- Distinguish from siblings:
  - behavior is correct but you want it different → `orch-change-feature`.
  - the capability does not exist yet → `orch-add-feature`.

## Operation settings

- **Default size floor:** small (often trivial).
- **Phase mask:** 0 → (light 2 only if root cause is non-obvious or standard+) →
  4 → 5 → 6. Research (1) is usually skipped.
- **First move (phase 4):** reproduce the bug as a **new failing** test
  (regression test), then fix until it goes green. Proving the bug exists first
  is what separates a fix from a tweak.

## How It Works

1. Run the `orch-pipeline` engine with the settings above.
2. If the root cause is unclear, scope it with `code-explorer` before the red
   test; escalate build breaks to `build-error-resolver` / `/build-fix`.
3. Stop at **Gate 1** (only if a plan was produced) and **Gate 2** (pre-commit).
4. Add `security-reviewer` if the defect sits in a security-sensitive path.

## Example

```
orch-fix-defect: poller crashes on empty NWS response
→ write failing test reproducing the crash → fix to green
→ code-review → commit  [GATE 2: confirm]   (commit: fix:)
```
