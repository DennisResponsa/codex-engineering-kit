## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

# FastAPI Review

Invoke the `fastapi-reviewer` agent for a focused FastAPI review.

## Usage

```text
/fastapi-review [file-or-directory]
```

## Review Areas

- App factory, router boundaries, middleware, and exception handlers.
- Pydantic request and response schema separation.
- Dependency injection for database sessions, auth, pagination, and settings.
- Async database and external HTTP patterns.
- CORS, auth, rate limits, logging, and secret handling.
- OpenAPI metadata and documented response models.
- Test client setup and dependency overrides.

## Expected Output

```text
[SEVERITY] Short issue title
File: path/to/file.py:42
Issue: What is wrong and why it matters.
Fix: Concrete change to make.
```
