## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

# Instinct Export Command

Exports instincts to a shareable format. Perfect for:
- Sharing with teammates
- Transferring to a new machine
- Contributing to project conventions

## Usage

```
/instinct-export                           # Export all personal instincts
/instinct-export --domain testing          # Export only testing instincts
/instinct-export --min-confidence 0.7      # Only export high-confidence instincts
/instinct-export --output team-instincts.yaml
/instinct-export --scope project --output project-instincts.yaml
```

## What to Do

1. Detect current project context
2. Load instincts by selected scope:
   - `project`: current project only
   - `global`: global only
   - `all`: project + global merged (default)
3. Apply filters (`--domain`, `--min-confidence`)
4. Write YAML-style export to file (or stdout if no output path provided)

## Output Format

Creates a YAML file:

```yaml
# Instincts Export
# Generated: 2025-01-22
# Source: personal
# Count: 12 instincts

# Prefer Functional Style

## Action
Use functional patterns over classes.
```

## Flags

- `--domain <name>`: Export only specified domain
- `--min-confidence <n>`: Minimum confidence threshold
- `--output <file>`: Output file path (prints to stdout when omitted)
- `--scope <project|global|all>`: Export scope (default: `all`)
