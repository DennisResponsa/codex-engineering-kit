## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

A structured feature-development workflow that emphasizes understanding existing code before writing new code.

## Phases

### 1. Discovery

- read the feature request carefully
- identify requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
- ask clarifying questions if the request is ambiguous

### 2. Codebase Exploration

- use `code-explorer` to analyze the relevant existing code
- trace execution paths and architecture layers
- understand integration points and conventions

### 3. Clarifying Questions

- present findings from exploration
- ask targeted design and edge-case questions
- wait for user response before proceeding

### 4. Architecture Design

- use `code-architect` to design the feature
- provide the implementation blueprint
- wait for approval before implementing

### 5. Implementation

- implement the feature following the approved design
- prefer TDD where appropriate
- keep commits small and focused

### 6. Quality Review

- use `code-reviewer` to review the implementation
- address critical and important issues
- verify test coverage

### 7. Summary

- summarize what was built
- list follow-up items or limitations
- provide testing instructions
