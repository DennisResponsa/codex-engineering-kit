## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

# Projects Command

List project registry entries and per-project instinct/observation counts for continuous-learning-v2.

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" projects
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py projects
```

## Usage

```bash
/projects
```

## What to Do

1. Read `~/.claude/homunculus/projects.json`
2. For each project, display:
   - Project name, id, root, remote
   - Personal and inherited instinct counts
   - Observation event count
   - Last seen timestamp
3. Also display global instinct totals
