## Codex execution contract

Use the current Codex session model and its native tools. Model names such as Sonnet, Opus or Haiku in source examples are not model-selection instructions. Follow the current user request and project instructions before upstream workflow defaults.

Read/Grep/Glob map to native file reading and search; Bash maps to the available shell tool. Task/Agent means authorized Codex delegation, not Claude CLI. Tool frontmatter is descriptive, not a permission grant. Do not assume slash commands or Claude lifecycle hooks exist. Use a project-supported test runner and report actual results.

Resolve bundled upstream scripts and references under the plugin's `vendor/ecc/` directory. Do not use personal `~/.claude` paths or unset `CLAUDE_*` variables in Codex. Inspect example commands and translate their intent before running them. Prefer existing connected tools. Missing external services must be reported, not simulated.

Skills that specifically integrate Anthropic or another provider still require that provider; do not call those services or switch models unless requested. Do not run upstream installers, auto-updaters, learning loops, background jobs, commits, deployments or messages solely because an example suggests them. Use this distribution's documented installer for its roles.

# AI-First Engineering

Use this skill when designing process, reviews, and architecture for teams shipping with AI-assisted code generation.

## Process Shifts

1. Planning quality matters more than typing speed.
2. Eval coverage matters more than anecdotal confidence.
3. Review focus shifts from syntax to system behavior.

## Architecture Requirements

Prefer architectures that are agent-friendly:
- explicit boundaries
- stable contracts
- typed interfaces
- deterministic tests

Avoid implicit behavior spread across hidden conventions.

## Code Review in AI-First Teams

Review for:
- behavior regressions
- security assumptions
- data integrity
- failure handling
- rollout safety

Minimize time spent on style issues already covered by automation.

## Hiring and Evaluation Signals

Strong AI-first engineers:
- decompose ambiguous work cleanly
- define measurable acceptance criteria
- produce high-signal prompts and evals
- enforce risk controls under delivery pressure

## Testing Standard

Raise testing bar for generated code:
- required regression coverage for touched domains
- explicit edge-case assertions
- integration checks for interface boundaries
